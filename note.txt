i have this error in my console

"""Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 406 ()"""

Explanation
Looking at the network requests, I can see multiple 406 errors from PostgREST. The issue is that your code is requesting application/vnd.pgrst.object+json (expecting exactly one row) but getting 0 rows when no RSVP exists.

Searched for : application/vnd\.pgrst\.object\+json
Searched for : \.single\(\)
I found the issue! The code is using .single() in several places to check for RSVP records, but when no RSVP exists, PostgREST returns 0 rows which conflicts with .single() expecting exactly one row.

The fix is to use .maybeSingle() instead of .single() when checking for RSVPs that might not exist:

Edited :src/components/EventCard.tsx
Edited :src/pages/Events.tsx
Edited :src/pages/Calendar.tsx
Fixed! The 406 errors were caused by using .single() when checking for RSVP records that might not exist. Changed to .maybeSingle() which handles 0 rows gracefully.
